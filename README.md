# Assignment-5

This project centers around developing a neural network utilizing Python and relevant libraries. It includes the phases of designing, training, and testing the neural network on a specified dataset to assess its performance and efficiency. Additionally, the project offers valuable perspectives on evaluating machine learning models and strategies for their deployment.
## Getting Started
These guidelines will assist you in establishing the project on your local system for development and testing activities. Refer to the deployment section for information on executing the project in a production setting..

### Prerequisites
What you require to set up the software and the steps to install it:

Anaconda

To install the necessary dependencies:
pip install numpy pandas tensorflow matplotlib scikit-learn


### Installing

https://clouds.eos.ubc.ca/~phil/docs/problem_solving/01-Orientation/01.03-Installing-Anaconda-on-Windows.html
Complete the setup process by ensuring that all tests run successfully.

## Running the tests


Describe the steps required to execute the automated tests for this system.

### Break down into end-to-end tests

These tests ensure the entire workflow is validated, covering data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation

python test_script.py



This script verifies:

Loading and preprocessing of data.
Initialization and training of the model.
Evaluation and calculation of metrics.

### And coding style tests

These tests verify compliance with Python coding standards and conventions.

flake8 <project_directory>

This command verifies PEP 8 compliance and provides suggestions for correcting coding style issues.

## Deployment

To deploy the model on a live system:

1. Train the model and save it:
python train.py --save_model


2. Use a web framework like Flask or FastAPI to serve the model:
python app.py


3.Use a browser or HTTP clients such as Postman to access the model's API endpoint.
